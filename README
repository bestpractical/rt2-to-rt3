Migrating from RT 2.0 to RT 3.0 

This tool migrates your RT2 instance to an RT 3.0 instance. It transfers:

	Users
	Groups
	Queues
	Rights
	Tickets
	Custom Fields (Formerly Keywords)
	ACLs
	BASIC Scrips

It does NOT automatically migrate:

	Custom templates, 
	Custom Scrips, 
	Custom ScripActions, 
	Custom ScripConditions



Create a directory to hold your RT2 database dump. here we'll refer to it as
DIRNAME. Anywhere you see the string  "DIRNAME", replace it with the path to
your directory.

Tell rt-2.0-to-dumpfile where your RT libraries live. (Edit the 'use lib' lines)

Execute:
rt-2.0-to-dumpfile  DIRNAME

DIRNAME will now contain one file called "metadata" and one subdirectories
which contain about 1000 files, 1 file per ticket.


Install rt3. Let it set up your rt3 database.

Tell dumpfile-to-rt-3.0 where your RT libraries live. (Edit the 'use lib' lines)

If your RT instance contains tickets encoded in a characterset other than
"IS0-8859-1", you'll want to edit the value of $ENCODING in dumpfile-to-rt-3.0.


Execute:
dumpfile-to-rt-3.0 DIRNAME

Watch it spin.  If it crashes, please send a crashdump to rt-devel@lists.fsck.com
Importing is a heavy-weight process and for large databases can run for a very
long time. (Huge imports can take over 24 hours to run.) The import toolset now
ships with an "incremental" mode. The incremental mode will take care of any
users or tickets which have changed since the specified date. Once your initial
export has run, perform a secondary export:

rt-2.0-to-dumpfile NEWDIRNAME since 2003-01-01 

         (replace that date with the date before the initial export)

Then execute:

dumpfile-to-rt-3.0 NEWDIRNAME

It's important to note that this incremental importer _mandates_ that queues,
keyword selects, links and queue watchers not be changed on either RT instance
during the export/import period.
