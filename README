Migrating from RT 2.0 to RT 3.0 

Create a directory to hold your RT2 database dump. here we'll refer to it as
DIRNAME. Anywhere you see the string  "DIRNAME", replace it with the path to
your directory.

Tell rt-2.0-to-dumpfile where your RT libraries live. (Edit the 'use lib' lines)


Execute:
rt-2.0-to-dumpfile  DIRNAME

DIRNAME will now contain one file called "metadata" and one file per ticket.
That's right. one file for each ticket. If you've got an RT instance with
250,000 tickets, you might want to consider altering these scripts so you don't
create a directory with 250,000 files in it. If you do, there are likely other
users who'd greatly appreciate it if you posted them to rt-devel.


Install rt3. Let it set up your rt3 database.

Tell dumpfile-to-rt-3.0 where your RT libraries live. (Edit the 'use lib' lines)

If your RT instance contains tickets encoded in a characterset other than
"IS0-8859-1", you'll want to edit the value of $ENCODING in dumpfile-to-rt-3.0.


Execute:
dumpfile-to-rt-3.0 DIRNAME

Watch it spin. On my laptop, it processes approximately one ticket per second.
If it crashes, please send a crashdump to rt-devel@lists.fsck.com
